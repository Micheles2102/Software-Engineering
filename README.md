# Software-Engineering
# Software Engineering Repository.

This folder contains custom implementations of design patterns/streams within the field of software engineering. Design patterns represent recurring, well-structured solutions to common problems in software development, promoting modularity, flexibility, and code maintainability.

# Creational Patterns:

# Abstract Factory Method:

Description: Creates an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It provides an abstract class with multiple factory methods to instantiate these objects.
# Bridge:

Description: Separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It involves a bridge interface that contains methods to be implemented by different concrete classes.
# Factory Method:

Description: Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It provides an interface, leaving the choice of the class to be instantiated to its subclasses.
# Prototype:

Description: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. It allows for object creation without specifying the exact class of the object to be created.
# Singleton:

Description: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

# Structural Patterns:

# Adapter:
Description: Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
# Chain of Responsibility:
Description: Passes a request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
# Composite:
Description: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
# Decorator:
Description: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
# Facade:
Description: Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

# Behavioral Patterns:

# Command:
Description: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the parameters.
# Observer:
Description: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

How to Use Design Patterns:

Each design pattern is contained in a separate directory.
Within each directory, you'll find details about the pattern's structure and an example implementation in a specific programming language (e.g., Java, Python, etc.).
Contributions:

If you'd like to contribute new design patterns or enhance existing ones, feel free to open a pull request. We welcome new ideas and improvements!
# Notes:
Ensure you understand the correct usage of each design pattern before implementing it in your projects.
The patterns provided here are created for educational purposes and can be adapted to suit the specific needs of your project.
This description offers clear organization and guidance on how to use and contribute to the design patterns in your "Software Engineering" folder. Customize it according to your needs and development style.

# Stream:
Primary Description:
In addition to design patterns, this repository also explores the concept of Java streams. In Java, a stream is a sequence of elements that supports various methods to perform aggregate operations on them. Streams provide a concise and functional approach to processing collections of data.

# Java Streams:
What is a Stream in Java?
In Java, a stream is a powerful and flexible tool for processing data collections. It allows for functional-style operations on elements, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, making code more expressive and readable.

Key Characteristics:

Lazy Evaluation: Operations are evaluated only when needed.
Pipelining: Multiple operations can be performed in a pipeline fashion.
Parallel Execution: Streams can leverage parallel processing for improved performance
